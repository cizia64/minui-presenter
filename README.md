# minui message

This is a minui message app. It allows displaying messages on the screen.

## Requirements

- A minui union toolchain
- Docker (this folder is assumed to be the contents of the toolchain workspace directory)
- `make`

## Building

- todo: this is built inside-out. Ideally you can clone this into the MinUI workspace directory and build from there under each toolchain, but instead it gets cloned _into_ a toolchain workspace directory and built from there.

## Usage
